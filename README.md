Based on the codebase context, you're asking me to write a short README for the **KLAWQ: KL-Aware Weight Quantization** framework in the `ha405/Compression-Framework-for-EdgeAI` repository. 

# KLAWQ: KL-Aware Weight Quantization for Edge AI

A novel post-training quantization framework that enhances GPTQ by integrating KL divergence for better accuracy preservation when deploying Large Language Models on edge devices. [1](#0-0) 

## Core Innovation

KLAWQ extends GPTQ by adding a KL divergence term to align quantized model outputs with the original model's distribution: [2](#0-1) 

```
L(Q) = L_MSE(Q) + β * L_KL(Q)
```

The algorithm modifies the Hessian computation as `H_tot = H + βA`, where `A` is the KL Hessian matrix. [3](#0-2) 

## Key Components

- **Configuration**: Hyperparameters (`β`, `τ`) in `KLAWQ/gptqmodel/quantization/config.py` [4](#0-3) 
- **Core Algorithm**: KL Hessian computation in `KLAWQ/kl-aware-quant/quantization/gptq.py` [5](#0-4) 
- **Quantization Engine**: Low-level operations in `KLAWQ/kl-aware-quant/quantization/quantizer.py` [6](#0-5) 
- **Analysis Notebooks**: Experimental validation in `kl-hessian-gptq-*.ipynb` files [7](#0-6) 

## Quick Start

1. **Clone and Setup**: [8](#0-7) 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ha405/Compression-Framework-for-EdgeAI
   cd Compression-Framework-for-EdgeAI
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Install PyTorch, transformers, and other requirements from `requirements.txt` 

3. **Run Quantization**: Use the Jupyter notebooks for experimentation or integrate the KLAWQ modules directly 

## Results

Experiments on GPT-2 at 8-bit precision demonstrate improved perplexity scores compared to vanilla GPTQ while maintaining post-training quantization efficiency. [9](#0-8) 

## Notes

The framework is built on a comprehensive infrastructure stack including PyTorch >=2.4.1, transformers >=4.51.2, and FastAPI for model serving.  The project structure shows a modular design with separate components for adapter functionality, model definitions, and processing loops, though the core KLAWQ innovation is concentrated in the quantization modules.
